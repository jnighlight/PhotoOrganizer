PhotoOrganizer

This is my project for organizing the over 19,000 photos I had terribly thrown about my various hard drives over many years.
I knew I had many duplicates in all my backups, and figured that the only way to organize photos long term was by date.
I built a script to recursively check a folder for files, note any duplicates, and organize them by year and date to an out directory.
Use at your own risk.
